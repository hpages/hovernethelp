# We exclude the 541 images from the TCGA-LUAD project (Lung adenocarcinoma
# study). Many of them seem to be causing problems:
# - Some of them are huge (in terms of nb of pixels) and they trigger
#   many "leaked semaphore objects" errors on JS2 g3.large instances,
#   even with 'nr_inference_workers=1'.
# - Others trigger the "KeyError" error or Bus error (with core dumped).
# See infer_batch.sh for the details.
